# Kaggle Projects

This repository contains code for various **Kaggle competitions** I've worked on.  
Each folder includes the **full workflow** — from data preprocessing and exploration to model training, evaluation, and submission.

Current projects:
- **Titanic** – Decision Tree baseline model for the Titanic survival prediction challenge.

More competitions and experiments will be added over time.
